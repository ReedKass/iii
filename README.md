Part A: Improving Locality Through Blocking


Architecture: We implemented the blocked UArray2 within our uarray2b.c,
                which is represented as a long UArray. We found this
                representation simple to maintain throughout our programming. 
                In order to rotate images, we initialize empty an UArray2b
                to properly fill with the data from the inputted file. 
                Our functions calc_Row and calc_Col find every index of a
                given cell, both within the larger UArray2 and within
                its block.

Part B: Supporting Polymorphic manipulation of 2D Arrays


Architecture: We implemented a2plain.c using the desired method suite and 
                following the format of a2blocked.c. a2plain.c contains the
                implementation of the functions necessary for the given 
                uarray2b.h and uarray2b.c to work.

Part C: ppmtrans

We could not figure out why our implementation wouldn't work with the
-time command. Similarly, we couldn't understand why our implementation didn't
work with -flip command. 
Architecture: We implemented ppmtrans.c in line with the spec, 
                utilizing the pre-written methods suite. Depending on
                the rotation being called, a map call is made on the
                inputted PPM to be written to a UArray2. 
                By passing the methods suite into our functions, 
                we have access to the functions within it. 
                The rotation functions are called on every single pixel in the
                image, putting them in their correct position in the UArray2. 
                These functions find the new index of the pixel and place it. 
                Then, the new image is printed. 

                Our timing data is stored within Recorder.txt: mapping type,
                rotation, total time and average time spent per pixel.

Part D: Analyzing Locality

We used this basic 2D Array to formulate our answers to the table.
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
We said that in row-major, this array looks like:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
We said that in col-major, this array looks like:
1 5 9 13 2 6 10 14 3 7 11 15 4 8 12 16
We said that in block-major, this array looks like:
1 2 5 6 3 4 7 8 9 10 13 14 11 12 1 16
A 90-degree rotation would look like:
13 9 5 1
14 10 6 2
15 11 7 3
16 12 8 4
A 180-degree rotation would look like:
16 15 14 13
12 11 10 9
8 7 6 5
4 3 2 1
We know from class that cache miss for writes are more expensive
for cache misses for reads.Therefore, it is better for a 
translation function to write a consecutive block in 
its entirety than for it to have to have to write to new 
memory every time through. 
Additionally, our UArray2 implementation is in row-major 
form, which alters our hypotheses.
Looking at the 180-degree rotation, it is clear that col-major 
will be able to write 
consecutive blocks (consecutive elements in columns) in their entirety. 
Therefore, we predict it will have the best cache hit rate of the set. 
A 180-degree rotation using block major will be half as efficient,
as there will be two
cache misses for writes per block. This also goes for 
0-degree rotations using block major. 
However, a 180-degree rotation using row-major requires 
3 cache misses per block, 
therefore it is significantly  less efficient. 90-degree rotations using
col major will also have 3 cache misses 
but they will be more efficient misses. 
Finally, 90 degree rotations using row major 
will be the least efficient due to their
number of misses per accessed block of memory.
All of our estimates are underestimates 
because our cache can size

Our UArray2 is stored in row major order, hence reading and writing 
in row major are the fastest because we are accessing continuous memory. 
This results in a high cache hit rate. Rotating 180 degrees using row major 
is the fastest because we are reading and writing in row major. 
Using col major to rotate 90 degrees is faster because we are writing to rows.
Blocked rotations take far longer than unblocked rotatins.
